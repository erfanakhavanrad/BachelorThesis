## BachelorThesis
Under the guidance of Dr. Parisa Rahmani and in collaboration with the software team at Taraz Group, I   
developed a sophisticated Ticketing System as my masterâ€™s thesis project. Key highlights of the project include:

- Technologies Used: Java Spring Boot (backend), VueJS (frontend), and MySQL Server (database). 
- Functionality: Designed to streamline client support operations by enabling efficient ticket creation, 
management, and tracking.
- Achievements: Successfully integrated industry requirements with academic objectives, gaining hands-on 
experience in system analysis, development, and deployment.

"TWS" as the backend project and "TarazTicket" as the frontend project.
